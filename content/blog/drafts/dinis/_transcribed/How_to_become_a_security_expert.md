How to become a security expert

There are many paths to becoming a security professional, but the best way to really get your head around security is to find and exploit security vulnerabilities. This is especially valuable for developers, who have a good understanding of technology and are moving into the security space. We have a number of them on our team. 

As experts, one of our responsibilities is to mentor up-and-coming security professionals -- how can we take an expert in one field and take them to the next level by adding a fundamental understanding of security. It's not a simple process. 

The first step is to get your hands dirty: Find vulnerabilities, then write the exploits. Through this process, you really begin to understand the different types of vulnerabilities and the variability of the exploits. Finally, turn around and fix the issues.

This workflow will walk you through the mindset shift that you need to be thinking about security. At the end, you'll better understand specific security issues, such as data validation, data handling, and the threat of data-injection attacks. You'll understand the problems with authentication authorization and trusting who has the data and who is making decisions. You'll understand the problem of encryption and protecting data and the value of assets. You'll also understand the human element and the workflows of both the attacker and the defender.

You will develop the necessary mindset to think about security.

So, how do you do it? First, hit the books. Books are a great way to learn. We end up getting any books that the team wants, so our library has grown quite large. Books are basically master classes, where the reader can focus on the content and learn the information at their own pace.

Along with learning the material through books, it's important to do hands-on exercises. We use Avatron which is a Hackathon platform, which we make available to our entire security team. Depending on your career path, we direct you toward specific exercises. You can get hands on experience with vulnerabilities, without actually breaking into production software. Because the Hackathon challenges are often quite tricky, this is a great learning experience. Just doing the exercises will often teach you a lot and gives a lot of "Ah Ha!" moments.

While continuing to read and reinforcing that reading with practice, the next step it to create exploits yourselves. Being able to create exploits is important for creating software security tests. Creating such tests allows you to distribute your knowledge so that developers can learn from those vulnerability patterns. Once you can do that, you have a way to replicate the findings.

Another good exercise is to take an application, and first exploit them and then write fixes for them. As an exercise, that is very powerful, because it allows you to understand that actually fixing things and creating security protectors is much harder than breaking software.

This is a long process, but it starts with breaking software. In my opinion, unless you start from the viewpoint of the attacker, you will struggle. Because you don't know what to test and have not developed an attacker's instincts, you have gaps in your understanding. 

Finally, a critical part of your learning process is to ask questions. So find people that you respect, and ask. Every security professional has started from zero. And every good security professional loves to teach. So, don't be afraid to ask questions. 

The flip side of that is, as you become more knowledgeable, seek out opportunities to teach and present. The best way to learn is to teach. So, one your the final stages of learning is to actually present and teach. In addition to gaining the respect of your peers, presenting is, to be honest, the best job interview ever.
