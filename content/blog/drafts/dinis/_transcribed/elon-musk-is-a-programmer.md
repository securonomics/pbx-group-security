I just read Elon Musk's biography, which I highly recommend. One of the interesting takeaways, which I did not know before reading, was that Musk is an excellent programmer and designer. It is evident throughout the book as he reveals his history. Musk came from a programing background, he loved to code. 
Fundamentally he knew how to write code at a deep level, beginning in his childhood. It is evident in his thinking, he thinks like a programmer. He breaks problems into logical bits, he finds out what it will take to solve those problems. Then he breaks them down further into small chunks, and executes them one at the time.
I also think that he is very good at understanding the compound effect of programming, or problem solving. By that I mean that you may start with ten problems but, in fact, the seventh or eighth problem can often be addressed by something that you used to solve the first couple of problems. It's not unlike the microchip designer scenario, where they know that the next version of the microchip will be designed based on the version they are designing now. You benefit from scale, and that philosophy is revealed by how he thinks and operates.
His other big skill is design. His approach is to design the experience, not just the looks, which are, of course, also very important. He deliberates the function, with a great level of understanding about how things work. If you examine Musk and how his companies operate, you see that he doesn’t just build a device, he builds the factory to build the device, in a way the whole life-cycle process itself is the machine. This is very important, because ultimately, it's the machine that builds the machine. 
It's just like an article that I've read recently about Amazon. It's about creating those environments where you can iterate very quickly in specific areas and, of course, self-contain wisely. 
The final philosophy that Musk adopted from programming, which is also referred to as agile in the web world, is the whole integrate fast concept. It is dependent on learning and then integrating that knowledge and then learning again. Just look at the technological innovation coming from the companies that he leads, for example, Tesla and the others. Their success is based on the fact that they learn so fast. They use software, in a way, that outstrips the attempts by other companies. 
Tesla cars auto update themselves. It's not just the software, it’s about how they apply it, they do the same thing with satellites, you know. They keep pushing, they put auto updates into satellites in space. Deploying fast has become second nature and they are doing it at the hardware, and power tools levels.
So, programming skills, deep design and integrate fast are the three key factors that, I believe, have contribute to Musk’s success. Not to dismiss his incredible drive, and the fact that he leads by example and works crazy hours. Personally, I do think that there must be balance. Musk is also very focused on the environment that people work in. The environment matters, if you create the time and space where people can get into the zone and are happily productive, this impacts how effective a company can be. 
I think our challenge is to implement these same skills in addition to creating environments where people enjoy performing and are part of a high performing team. We must nurture fluidity, where everything flows and everybody is aligned in the same direction. The challenge, of course, is how to do that, right? This is what we are motivated to create here, at group security, we aim to be one of those highly effective teams, that can make a difference.
So, yes, it is very inspiring and interesting to get insights into how Musk thinks and how the quality and updatability; the design and the energy, is creating outcomes that are literally changing the world. 
=======
Elon Musk’s greatest weapon is that he analyzes the world with a programmer’s eye. In his biography, he talks about his love of code. He breaks problems into logical bits, finds out what he needs to solve a problem, and then executes the solution — his program — one step at the time.

This ability to analyze a problem and break it down into its constituent parts has served him well as the founder of PayPal, Space X, and Tesla Motors. 

But his programmer’s approach to business goes beyond just framing the problem and its solution. The ability to automate and scale — the “compound interest” of programming — has also paid dividends for Musk. He understands that solving ten related problems does not take ten times as long as a single problem. By building on previous solutions, the seventh or eighth problem benefits from the solution to every past problem. The ability to scale and automate has made his businesses efficient and agile.

Finally, his love of programming has given Musk strong insights into how to design products and business processes. The focus on design goes beyond just the look of a product and the experience of using it. His design goes all the way back through the process of building the device. He builds the factory to build the device, treating the whole process itself as a machine. By focusing on the entire design of the product from creation to use, his businesses can iterate very fast in specific areas.

Musk’s ability to treat business as a programming problem has made his businesses agile and responsive to change. His companies innovate quickly because they learn fast. Tesla’s cars were the first ones to auto-update, for example, allowing the company to deploy fast and respond to security threats.

While Musk is known to work crazy hours, he has focused on the environment of his workers. He has shown that, if you can create periods where people get into the zone and remain happy, they can be very productive and effective. 

At PhotoBox Group Security, we have taken Musk’s lessons to heart. We are trying to create and maintain one of those highly effective teams that can make a difference. He inspires us in the way that he thinks about quality and updatability, design and the energy. And like him, we hope to actually create things that will literally change the world.
