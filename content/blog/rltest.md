Elon Musk’s greatest weapon is that he analyzes the world with a programmer’s eye. In his biography, he talks about his love of code. He breaks problems into logical bits, finds out what he needs to solve a problem, and then executes the solution — his program — one step at the time.

This ability to analyze a problem and break it down into its constituent parts has served him well as the founder of PayPal, Space X, and Tesla Motors. 

But his programmer’s approach to business goes beyond just framing the problem and its solution. The ability to automate and scale — the “compound interest” of programming — has also paid dividends for Musk. He understands that solving ten related problems does not take ten times as long as a single problem. By building on previous solutions, the seventh or eighth problem benefits from the solution to every past problem. The ability to scale and automate has made his businesses efficient and agile.

Finally, his love of programming has given Musk strong insights into how to design products and business processes. The focus on design goes beyond just the look of a product and the experience of using it. His design goes all the way back through the process of building the device. He builds the factory to build the device, treating the whole process itself as a machine. By focusing on the entire design of the product from creation to use, his businesses can iterate very fast in specific areas.

Musk’s ability to treat business as a programming problem has made his businesses agile and responsive to change. His companies innovate quickly because they learn fast. Tesla’s cars were the first ones to auto-update, for example, allowing the company to deploy fast and respond to security threats.

While Musk is known to work crazy hours, he has focused on the environment of his workers. He has shown that, if you can create periods where people get into the zone and remain happy, they can be very productive and effective. 

At PhotoBox Group Security, we have taken Musk’s lessons to heart. We are trying to create and maintain one of those highly effective teams that can make a difference. He inspires us in the way that he thinks about quality and updatability, design and the energy. And like him, we hope to actually create things that will literally change the world.
